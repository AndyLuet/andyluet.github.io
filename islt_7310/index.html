                Hello! I'm Andrew. I'm a UX/UI Designer and Illustrator with a
                passion for clean, minimalistic design.
            </p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                My goal for this website is to showcase my skills as a designer
                to help aid me in searching for jobs. I want to show potential
                employers what I am capable of and why they should hire me. I
                hope to be able to showcase some of the previous UX/UI design
                work I have done, as well as some illustrations I have made. I
                would like there to be a unique "about me" section showcasing
                things that I am interested in.
