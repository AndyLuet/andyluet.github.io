            <p>
                Hello, I'm Andrew. UX/UI Design is my passion and a skill I am
                constantly improving. I have 1 year of work experience and 7
                years of training under my belt. Creating memorable experiences
                on the web is my main goal. Making those experiences accessible
                to all is my second goal. I enjoy anything to do with design,
                creating logos and updating website designs in my free time.
                Outside of UX/UI Design, you will find me hiking, petting dogs,
                or building computers. I am a life-long animal lover and will
                try to meet new animals any chance I get. I graduated from the
                University of Missouri in May with a degree in Web Design. I am
                certified in a large number of Adobe CC products, as well as
                HTML 5 and CSS 3. I am excited to start my career and start
                making real, impactful changes to the web!
            </p>
