        <h3>Some things about me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm <em>Andrew</em>. <b>UX/UI Design</b> is my passion and a
            skill I am constantly improving. I have 1 year of work experience
            and 7 years of training under my belt. Creating memorable
            experiences on the web is my main goal. Making those experiences
            accessible to all is my second goal. I enjoy anything to do with
            design, creating logos and updating website designs in my free
            time.<br />
            Outside of UX/UI Design, you will find me hiking, petting dogs, or
            building computers. I am a life-long animal lover and will try to
            meet new animals any chance I get. I graduated from the University
            of Missouri in May with a degree in Web Design. I am certified in a
            large number of Adobe CC products, as well as HTML 5 and CSS 3. I am
            excited to start my career and start making real,
            <em>impactful</em> changes to the web!
        </p>
