        Hello, I'm Andrew. UX/UI Design is my passion and a skill I am
        constantly improving. I have 1 year of work experience and 7 years of
        training under my belt. Creating memorable experiences on the web is my
        main goal. Making those experiences accessible to all is my second goal.
        I enjoy anything to do with design, creating logos and updating website
        designs in my free time. Outside of UX/UI Design, you will find me
        hiking, petting dogs, or building computers. I am a life-long animal
        lover and will try to meet new animals any chance I get. I graduated
        from the University of Missouri in May with a degree in Web Design. I am
        certified in a large number of Adobe CC products, as well as HTML 5 and
        CSS 3. I am excited to start my career and start making real, impactful
        changes to the web!
