                <span>I</span> started working with design back in 2014 when I
                was first introduced to programs such as Photoshop and
                Illustrator. I went to a high school called RockBridge here in
                Columbia, MO. It was at this school that I met a teacher who
                would be very influential in my life and career choice. Patrick
                Sasser taught a Web Design class which I took in 2016. This
                class taught me the very basics of web design and why it is
                important. I instantly fell in love with web design. It allowed
                me to take my love for design and share it with thousands of
                people around the world through the web. I wanted to create
                beautiful sites where people would enjoy their experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of high school and most of college, I was either taking
                classes on design, or I was doing freelance work to help build
                my name and experience. Creating small graphics for streamers
                (twitch.tv) and small websites for free for local businesses
                were just a few of the ways I built my experience during my free
                time in college. In 2021, I applied and was accepted to be a
                UX/UI Designer at MidwayUSA, which was a huge step in my career
                as a web designer. Late last year, I was given an offer by
                MidwayUSA to work full time for the company when I graduate from
                the University of Missouri in May of 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                My career goals are to eventually run my own design company. I
                want to take contract work from clients around the world and
                have complete control over the future design of the web. This is
                something that I have wanted for as long as I can remember, and
                I hope to make it come true in the near future.
            </p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Overall, I feel as though my career is just starting. I hope to
                have many more memorable work experiences in the future. I also
                hope to advance as a designer and illustrator, honing my skills
                and gaining enough experience to land a job anywhere I apply. My
                ultimate goal for my career is to own my own tech-based company.
                I have no idea what this company will do or what it will be
                named, but I hope to do this in the future.
